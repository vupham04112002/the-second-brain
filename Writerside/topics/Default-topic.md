## Wassup! I'm Vũ
* I like cats
* I also appreciate plants, Monstera is my most favorite
* I have some experience in growing plants and managing them
* I vibe with old-school music like jazz-rap, hip-hop, and metal rock ([check out my recent favorite track](https://open.spotify.com/track/4AE7Lj39VnSZNOmGH2iZaq?si=4da5861969504270))
